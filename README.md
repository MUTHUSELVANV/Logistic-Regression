# Logistic-Regression
Generally, the Supervised Learning Algorithm used for predicting class is Logistic Regression. Here, we have 2 features 'x1' & 'x2' and a target variable with 3 classes - 'Approved', 'Onhold' and 'Reject'.
 Initially, data has been randomly created, then splitted and scaled the data for performing logistic regression. Later, performed logistic regression with input as training dataset. Once, done with the training, we evaluate the model with the testing data to calculate evaluation metrics like accuracy score & recall score(f1 score)
Atlast, we Visualize the data to understand the working of model visually.
